THE

BUTTERFLY'S BALL.


  Come take up your Hats, and away let us haste
  To the _Butterfly's_ Ball, and the _Grasshopper's_ Feast.
  The Trumpeter, _Gad-fly_, has summon'd the Crew,
  And the Revels are now only waiting for you.

  So said little Robert, and pacing along,
  His merry Companions came forth in a Throng.
  And on the smooth Grass, by the side of a Wood,
  Beneath a broad Oak that for Ages had stood,

[Illustration: _"Saw the children of earth & the tenants of air,"_]

  Saw the Children of Earth, and the Tenants of Air,
  For an Evening's Amusement together repair.
  And there came the _Beetle_, so blind and so black,
  Who carried the _Emmet_, his Friend, on his Back.

  And there was the _Gnat_ and the _Dragon-fly_ too,
  With all their Relations, Green, Orange, and Blue.
  And there came the _Moth_, with his Plumage of Down,
  And the _Hornet_ in Jacket of Yellow and Brown;

  Who with him the _Wasp_, his Companion, did bring,
  But they promis'd, that Evening, to lay by their Sting.
  And the sly little _Dormouse_ crept out of his Hole,
  And brought to the Feast his blind Brother, the _Mole_.

[Illustration: _"And the sly little dormouse crept out of his hole."_]

  And the _Snail_, with his Horns peeping out of his Shell,
  Came from a great Distance, the Length of an Ell.
  A Mushroom their Table, and on it was laid
  A Water-dock Leaf, which a Table-cloth made.

[Illustration: _"And the Bee brought her honey," &c._]

  The Viands were various, to each of their Taste,
  And the _Bee_ brought her Honey to crown the Repast.
  Then close on his Haunches, so solemn and wise,
  The _Frog_ from a Corner, look'd up to the Skies.

  And the _Squirrel_ well pleas'd such Diversions to see,
  Mounted high over Head, and look'd down from a Tree.
  Then out came the _Spider_, with Finger so fine,
  To shew his Dexterity on the tight Line.

  From one Branch to another, his Cobwebs he slung,
  Then quick as an Arrow he darted along,
  But just in the Middle,--Oh! shocking to tell,
  From his Rope, in an Instant, poor Harlequin fell.

[Illustration: _"Hung suspended in air," &c._]

  Yet he touch'd not the Ground, but with Talons outspread,
  Hung suspended in Air, at the End of a Thread.
  Then the _Grasshopper_ came with a Jerk and a Spring,
  Very long was his Leg, though but short was his Wing;

  He took but three Leaps, and was soon out of Sight,
  Then chirp'd his own Praises the rest of the Night.
  With Step so majestic the _Snail_ did advance,
  And promis'd the Gazers a Minuet to dance.

[Illustration: _"With step so Majestic the snail did advance,"_]

  But they all laugh'd so loud that he pull'd in his Head,
  And went in his own little Chamber to Bed.
  Then, as Evening gave Way to the Shadows of Night,
  Their Watchman, the _Glow-worm_, came out with a Light.

[Illustration: _"So said little Robert, & pacing along," &c._]

  Then Home let us hasten, while yet we can see,
  For no Watchman is waiting for you and for me,
  So said little Robert, and pacing along,
  His merry Companions returned in a Throng.



END OF THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL.
