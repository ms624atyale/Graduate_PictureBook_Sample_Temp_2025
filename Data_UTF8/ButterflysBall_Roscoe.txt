THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL,
                          AND THE
                    GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST.

                       By Mr. ROSCOE.


    Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste
  To the _Butterfly's_ Ball and the _Grasshopper's_ Feast:
  The Trumpeter, _Gadfly_, has summon'd the Crew,
  And the Revels are now only waiting for you.

    So said little Robert, and pacing along,
  His merry Companions came forth in a throng,
  And on the smooth Grass, by the side of a Wood
  Beneath a broad Oak that for ages had stood,
  Saw the Children of Earth, and the Tenants of Air,
  For an Evening's Amusement together repair.
  And there came the _Beetle_, so blind and so black,
  Who carried the _Emmet_, his Friend, on his back
  And there was the _Gnat_, and the _Dragon-fly_ too,
  With all their Relations, Green, Orange, and Blue.
  And there came the _Moth_, with his plumage of down,
  And the _Hornet_, in Jacket of Yellow and Brown;
  Who with him the _Wasp_, his Companion, did bring,
  But they promised that Evening to lay by their Sting.
  And the sly little _Dormouse_ crept out of his hole,
  And brought to the Feast his blind Brother, the _Mole_.
  And the _Snail_, with his Horns peeping out of his Shell,
  Came from a great distance, the Length of an Ell.
  A Mushroom their Table, and on it was laid
  A Water-dock Leaf, which a Table-cloth made.
  The Viands were various, to each of their taste,
  And the _Bee_ brought her Honey to crown the Repast.
  Then close on his haunches, so solemn and wise,
  The _Frog_ from a corner look'd up to the Skies;
  And the _Squirrel_, well pleased such diversions to see,
  Mounted high over-head, and look'd down from a Tree.
  Then out came the _Spider_, with finger so fine,
  To show his dexterity on the tight line.
  From one branch to another his Cobwebs he slung,
  Then quick as an arrow he darted along;
  But just in the middle,--Oh! shocking to tell,
  From his rope in an instant poor Harlequin fell.
  Yet he touch'd not the ground, but with talons outspread
  Hung suspended in air, at the end of a thread.
  Then the _Grasshopper_ came with a jerk and a spring;
  Very long was his Leg, though but short was his Wing:
  He took but three leaps, and was soon out of sight,
  Then chirp'd his own praises the rest of the night.
  With step so majestic the _Snail_ did advance,
  And promised the Gazers a Minuet to dance.
  But they all laugh'd so loud that he pull'd in his head,
  And went in his own little chamber to bed.
  Then, as Evening gave way to the Shadows of Night,
  Their Watchman, the _Glowworm_, came out with a light.

    Then Home let us hasten, while yet we can see,
  For no watchman is waiting for you and for me.
  So said little Robert, and pacing along,
  His merry Companions return'd in a throng.




                            THE
                        FANCY FAIR;

                            OR,

                         GRAND GALA
                           OF THE
                    ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.


    Some years are elapsed, and some worthies are gone,
  Since _Peacocks_ and _Butterflies_ mimick'd the _ton_,
  And gave, in a manner becoming their station,
  Their _fêtes_ and their _balls_ to their fellow-creation.
  Then _Roscoe_ and _Dorset_, high-talented elves,
  Amused other people and solaced themselves,
  In describing the revels, the gibes, and the jokes,
  Of the creatures of earth, and the feathery folks;
  Of their fashion and fancy, the ebbs and the flows,
  And the beauty and wit of their belles and their beaux.
  But the world has spun round like a peg top since then,
  And imparted more knowledge to brutes and to men;
  New lights and perceptions old customs explode,
  And what is done now, must be done _à-la-mode_.
  Old fashions are fled, and what more can we say
  Than that _Dorset_ and _Roscoe_ might do for that day,
  But that Poets must deck in more dignified rhymes
  The wonderful deeds of these wonderful times?
  That _Augusta_ may spread her renown and her glory,
  Her famed _Fancy Fairs_ must be studded in story,
  And ages unborn learn the elegant Games
  Of the _Gardens_ that bloom on the south of the Thames.
  Old _Dryden_ the bard was at best but a gander,
  In singing the _Feast_ of the great _Alexander_;
  For what breast with the fumes of a banquet is fired
  Two thousand years after the guests have retired?
  Our happier bard takes the season that suits,
  At the spur of the moment he puts on his boots,
  All hot for _Parnassus_, and cries in a hurry,
  "Prepare me my _Pegasus_! '_Saddle white Surrey!_'"
  It is clear that he feels what his numbers prolong,
  That he warms with his subject, and soars in his song.
  But whether his lot be unhonour'd and low,
  Or the wreath of the _Laureat_ encircles his brow,
  With the world to admire him, mysterious elf!
  Is a secret of state that he keeps to himself.
  But come! _Zoological_ wonders require
  The strains of his genius, his force and his fire;
  He burns with impatience the scene to display:
  Hark away, to the _Gardens of Taste_! Hark away!

    The sun, as he rose, was received with a cheer,
  From the Herald at Arms, the renown'd _Chanticleer_,
  Who proclaim'd, with a feeling of pride in his breast,
  That the _Gardens of Surrey_ were fairest and best.
  Then at once the shrill tidings were borne on the air,
  That the dawn had arrived of the famed _Fancy Fair_,
  And that all that was lovely, and beauteous, and bright,
  Was summon'd to honour that day of delight.
  The sunbeam was clear on that lovely retreat;
  The breath of the morning was balmy and sweet;
  Fair _flowrets_, that vied with the rainbow, were seen,
  And _trees_ in their livery of liveliest green.
  The voice of rejoicing, from children of earth,
  Was so mingled with cheerfulness, music, and mirth,
  That the mind, and the eye, and the ear, and the heart
  Were saluted with pleasure from every part.
  A thousand gay faces appear'd in the throng,
  And crowds of fair creatures came trooping along.
  Till the place, all enliven'd with joy and surprise,
  Was lit up with sunbeams and Beauty's bright eyes.
  The groups of all ages were gather'd so well,
  That they threw o'er the poet and painter a spell,
  And the flashes of fancy, wit, feeling, and fire,
  Resistless compell'd them to pause and admire.

    Much pains had been taken to add to the grace,
  And preserve from disorder the pride of the place;
  To keep the fair flowrets from wandering away,
  As well as the things that were fairer than they,
  For placards were posted near every spot,
  You may stand to "_admire_" me, "_but gather me not_."

    The _Beasts_ and the _Birds_ were so fresh and so fair,
  That they call'd forth the wonder of all who came there,
  And the _Boa Constrictors_ so slimy and gay,
  That they seem'd to have painted themselves for the day.
  The _Green-bonnet Monkey_, with speckles bespread,
  Was proud of the verdigris tuft on his head;
  For it look'd, as he leap'd in his frolic and joy,
  Like the top of the turban of _Rammohun Roy_.
  Dame _Tortoise_ roam'd over the green and beyond,
  For she pass'd on her pilgrimage right to the pond.
  As she gazed on the _Crocodile_ softly she sigh'd,
  Though she thought that his mouth was a _little_ too wide.
  The _Zebra_ look'd sprightly, as every one saw,
  And the _African Sheep_ and white-footed _Nyl Ghau_;
  And that leaper of leapers, the strange _Kangaroo_,
  That is biped and triped and quadruped too,
  Who out-juggles the _Juggler_, by hill and by dale;
  For he makes, when he pleases, a leg of his tail.
  With a soft, silky, aspect, demure and profound,
  A _tabby Cat_ wander'd the _Gardens_ around,
  And purr'd her applause with a quiet delight,
  As she gazed half-entranced on the heart-cheering sight.
  Among the rare wonders that caught every eye,
  Demanding a glance from the gay passer-by,
  Was the _Alpaca_, _Zebu_ of Indian race,
  And the _Camel_, brought up in that beautiful place.
  A dome in the centre, deservedly praised,
  Transparent as crystal, was artfully raised,
  Where African _Lions_, and _Tigers_ untamed,
  And _Sloths_ and _Hyænas_, for savageness famed,
  And _Leopards_ and _Ladies_, and _Monsters_ and _Men_,
  Securely might meet in the very same pen.

    The crowd still increased on that magical ground,
  And thousands and thousands came trooping around.
  The _haut ton_ and _beau monde_ paced about debonair,
  Tall and short, _enbonpoint_, slender, sunburnt, and fair,
  While Hatred and Anger and Care fled away,
  And light hearts and bright eyes were the charm of the day.
  Then the painted _balloon_ in its glory was bright,
  And it mounted on high till it sail'd out of sight.
  The _Juggler_, with tricks and illusions came forth,
  And the _Russians_ with _musical horns_ from the North,
  Transporting enough to make _Orpheus_ mute:
  As loud as the trumpet, as soft as the lute,
  They fill'd every bosom, absorbing them quite,
  And the _reeds_ seem'd to burden the air with delight.
  Such strains have rung round me in seasons gone by,
  When escaped from the cloister I mused with a sigh,
  And listed awhile to the balm-shedding breeze,
  As it fitfully swept through the sedge and the trees,
  And plaintively whisper'd with musical power,
  O'er the "soft-flowing Avon," at evening hour.

    And now the fair parties, with Mirth for their guide,
  And light-hearted Laughter, a moment divide,
  And gaze on the _Eagles_, the _old ruin'd wall_,
  The _Boat-house_, the _Temple_, the _Hermitage_, all;
  Reproved, when their pleasure too freely they quaff,
  By that _memento mori_, the Afric _Giraffe_.[1]

[Illustration]

    Some visit the laughing-bird, called _Cockatoo_,
  Who drops them a courtesy, and cries "How d' ye do?"
  Or Mungo, the _negro_, who quaintly and sly
  Takes his tea, Cayenne pepper, and cold apple-pie.
  Some gaze on the _Cygnets_ that glide like a dream,
  And bend down to admire their fair forms in the stream;
  Some laugh at their fancies, or muse on a flower,
  And all are delighted, so happy the hour.
  Wouldst thou gaze with emotions far purer than mirth
  On one of the fairest creations of earth,
  Go at even, and breathe the pure breath of the breeze,
  From the _seat_ by the _Lake_, 'neath those wild _Willow-trees_.

[Illustration]

    New pleasures succeeded; the spell was of power
  That Variety threw o'er the varying hour,
  And a change of enjoyment was found by the train
  In losing and finding each other again.
  The _dancing_ commenced, and the Fair, beyond praise,
  As light as the gossamer, tripp'd through the maze.
  What warm salutations! what laughing aloud!
  What sounds of enjoyment were heard in the crowd!
  But who were the worthies who moved with a grace
  And demeanour, as though they belong'd to the place?
  Prince Eglantine _Eagle_, with lightning-like glare,
  Threw a glance all around him to see who was there;
  To the _Pelican_ Princesses bent his head low,
  As they proudly pass'd by with their bosoms of snow.
  Duke _Emu_, too, gazed on the heart-cheering sight,
  And Earl Hildebrand _Harpy_, so famous in fight;
  While the figure that walk'd so erect, I suppose,
  Was Sir Peregrine _Penguin_,--I judge by his nose.
  Viscount _Stork_, as he strutted about, gave a beck
  To Earl _Vulture_, who wears no cravat round his neck;
  And the _Bishop_ was there, though he stood rather back,
  Array'd in his robes of red, orange, and black,
  Sir Archibald _Ostrich_ moved on rather chary,
  And lean'd on his cousin the Count _Cassowary_,
  Discoursing of _Java_, and far distant lands,
  And African _Deserts_, and hot burning sands.
  Old warrior _Flamingo_ came limping along,
  And with Commodore _Cormorant_ join'd in the throng,
  Profoundly debating, with Major _Macaw_,
  The merits of martial and maritime law.
  Earl _Heron_ walk'd stately with Caroline _Crane_,
  And Field-marshal _Falcon_, of valour so vain;
  While Captain _Crown Pigeon_, so odd in his tread,
  Shook the quaking-grass tuft on his fanciful head.
  Lord _Peacock_, from _Asia_, came dress'd very fine--
  His musical taste ne'er accorded with mine;
  And the learn'd Baron _Buzzard_, who gravely decided,
  That game, when once caught, should be fairly divided.
  The grenadier, Captain _Curassow_, was drest
  In his helmet, and held up his head with the best;
  While Fatima _Pheasant_, from China, display'd
  Her Pekin pelisse of bright silver brocade.
  Count _Turkey_ expanded the finery that bound him,
  And gabbled high Dutch to the people around him.
  His Honour the _Hawk_ loved a lark and a race,
  So he hover'd about near the courts of the place.
  Colonel _Kite_ spoke of sporting--of young _Ducks_ and _Widgeons_,
  And plann'd a new pent-house for _Ring-doves_ and _Pigeons_.
  At the edge of the water, and hard by the sluice,
  _Tête-à-tête_ Doctor _Drake_ sat with old Gammer _Goose_.
  And Sir Christopher _Crow_ wore a coat on his back,
  Of a true Day and Martin-like polish of black.
  Mother _Magpie_ and Priscilla _Parrot_, in spite,
  Could talk without ceasing from morning to night;
  Spread abroad _Entre nous_ and _On dits_ by the score,
  All the news they had heard, and a hundred times more.

[Illustration]

    A multitude muster'd, escaped from the plains,
  Of sight-loving lasses and holiday swains:
  Bob _Bantam_ push'd forward and strutted before;
  Will _Woodpecker_ modestly tapp'd at the door;
  Poor _Robin_, the rustic, a countrified clown,
  As he blush'd, look'd too simple by half for the town,
  There were scores in brown mantles, black, yellow, or green,
  From the villages round, and among them were seen,
  Luke _Linnet_, Sam _Swallow_, Mat _Martin_, and then,
  Bill _Bullfinch_, Tom _Titmouse_, and Rosanna _Wren_.
  But however select the fair party may be,
  Where beauty and fashion preside, we shall see
  Some characters doubtful that all should beware,
  And it can't be denied that a few such were there.
  Those cut-throats the _Sparrows_, that robber the _Daw_,
  Who was pluck'd for his open contempt of the law;
  The pilferer _Cuckoo_, whom all must despise,
  And the chattering _Jay_, who tells nothing but lies;
  While the green-mantled, light-hearted _Love-birds_, 'tis said,
  Had been sipping too much, for their noses were red.

    How often it is, when the sun is most bright,
  That a dark cloud approaches, obscuring his light!
  Alas! 'tis the same with all earthly affairs,
  And pleasure gives place to a dark crowd of cares.
  The _Trees_ were all lively, the _Beasts_ were content,
  And the beautiful _Birds_ on their pleasure were bent,
  Nothing doubting the multitude, struck with amaze,
  Came to gaze on their beauty and speak in their praise
  When they saw that the crowd by degrees had retired,
  And that they left alone were no longer admired;
  They gazed on the _Booths_ that were aptly design'd
  To display the fair merchandize art had combined;
  They look'd on the spot in wrath, spleen, and despair,
  _Rank_, _Beauty_, _Taste_, _Fashion_, and _Fancy_ were there,
  And the multitudes round such attractions preferr'd
  To a gambolling _beast_ or a chattering _bird_.
  Now Envy first enter'd the fair feather'd race,
  And invective and dissonance rung round the place;
  Their pleasure, their pride, and contentment were o'er,
  And Discord presided where Peace was before.

    In the midst of the hubbub and riot around,
  The _Trees_ were absorb'd in a silence profound,
  Till the busy _Dwarf Medlar_ began to explain
  His rooted dislike to the booth-loving train.
  He branch'd out in florid descriptions to show
  That they all ought to stand on their stumps in a row
  In defence of their rights, now that _underlings_ drew
  That applause and renown which had long been their due.
  Then the _Oak_ raised his head, rather hoary with age,
  And shook his broad arms in the air in a rage,
  And exhorted them all with a feeling of pride,
  To maintain their ground firmly, whate'er might betide.
  The _Giant Elm_ follow'd and proudly look'd down
  On the pitiful plots of their foes with a frown.
  The _Ash_, pale with anger, derided "the crew,"
  And the smooth-temper'd _Purple Beech_ look'd rather blue.
  The _Chesnut_ grew heated, and roasted them well;
  And bitter the taunts of the _Almond-tree_ fell.
  The _Apple_ and _Pear_ both maintain'd, in their spleen,
  That the fruit of their folly would shortly be seen.
  The _Laburnum_, the _Lime_, and the _Beech_ seem'd afraid,
  But the _Hawthorn_ was pointed in all that she said,
  And the threats of the _Elder_ were heard to abound--
  Like pellets from popguns they rattled around.
  Discontented and moody the _Drooping Larch_ lower'd,
  The _Crab_ knit his brows, for his temper was sour'd;
  While the _Birch_-tree declared that the ill-fated elves,
  Their opponents, were making a rod for themselves.
  With wrath and vexation the _Maple_ ran o'er;
  The _Aspen_-tree trembled, the _Willow_ wept sore;
  The _Tulip_-tree blush'd, and the _Sumach_-tree sigh'd,
  And the _Dyer's Oak_ thought it a stain on their pride.
  The _Fir_ stood erect, for he seem'd to opine
  That their sun for a very brief season would shine;
  While the well-meaning _Walnut_, foreboding their fall,
  Crack'd a joke, for he cared not a fig for them all.
  The _Poplar_ drew up with a feeling of scorn,
  And the _Cypress_ looked sad, and the _Yew_ was forlorn.
  The _Plane_ smoothly spoke, and the _Hazel_ the same,
  But the _Scarlet Oak_ redden'd with anger and shame.
  At last they resolved, to blot out the disgrace,
  To stand fast by each other adorning the place;
  No longer their loss of applause to bemoan,
  But to come out next spring with a Fair of their own.

    While the war-whoop was raised by the _Birds_ and the _Trees_,
  The _Beasts_ were impatient to blow up a breeze.
  The _Lion_ began with a royal bewail,
  And furiously lash'd both his sides with his tail.
  As he stalk'd through his den, his wild eyes glared around,
  And his roar seem'd to come from far under the ground.
  His anger, disdain, and despair wanted scope,
  So he wish'd himself back at the Cape of Good Hope.
  The _Tiger_ extended, in uttering a roar,
  A mouth that you might have mistook for the door;
  But in such a dilemma, I warn you, beware
  How you enter in haste such a dark thoroughfare;
  For all who have pass'd through the passage they say,
  Have terribly painted their coats by the way.
  Poor _Bruin_ declared it was unbearable quite,
  And was in a brown study till day turn'd to night;
  The _Axis_ turn'd round in his rage, and just then
  The _Sloth_ look'd as black as the ink in my pen.
  The soft, silky, self-colour'd _Puma_ felt pain,
  Pale as ashes with anger he could not restrain;
  The _Llama_ indignantly felt the disgrace,
  And spirted saliva in every one's face;
  In fury the _Mastiff_ bark'd loud for relief;
  The poor patient _Camel_ was laden with grief;
  The _Antelope_ wisely eloped from the fray,
  But the _Springbok_ was booked for the rest of the day.
  The wrath of the _Leopard_ then rose on the gale,
  And broke out in dark spots from his head to his tail;
  The _Civet Cat_ mew'd, and did nothing but fret,
  And the stripes of the _Zebra_ were blacker than jet;
  The _Opossum_ was posed, and looked wondrously sage,
  And the _Red Coati Mondi_ turned sallow with rage;
  The _Hyæna_ declared in a quarrelsome mood,
  He would instantly break through his den--if he could:
  And the _Moose Deer_ in ire would have bit his lip through,
  But he found it already divided in two.
  The Schoolmaster _Porcupine_ rang, too, the chimes,--
  He declar'd that he'd send an address to "_the Times_;"
  Nay, write all his quills to their stumps, ere he'd stand
  As a laughing-stock thus to the rest of the land.

    When the _Fair_ was concluded, and all the gay throng
  Had abandon'd the feast and the dance and the song,
  In quest of a calmer enjoyment to roam,
  For "Home," after every enjoyment, "is Home!"
  The _Trees_ toss'd their heads 'tween the earth and the heavens,
  And the _Birds_ and the _Beasts_ were at sixes and sevens.

    But amid the confusion, the hubbub, and din,
  All remember'd the proverb, "_They laugh most who win!_"
  This was certainly true at the famed _Fancy Fair_;
  _Mr. Cross_[2] was, they say, the most pleasant man there.
  Let us hope, then, his genius was happily led
  To allay the rude storm that hung over his head;--
  That the future his spirited plans will repay
  Through many a gladsome and prosperous day;
  Make true the old saw, "_All is well that well ends_,"
  And _Bipeds_ and _Quadrupeds_ once more be friends.

                          THE END.
