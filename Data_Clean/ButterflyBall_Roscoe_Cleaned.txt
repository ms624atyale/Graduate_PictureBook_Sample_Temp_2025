the butterfly's ball                           and the                     grasshopper's feast                         by mr roscoe       come take up your hats and away let us haste   to the butterfly's ball and the grasshopper's feast    the trumpeter gadfly has summon'd the crew   and the revels are now only waiting for you      so said little robert and pacing along   his merry companions came forth in a throng   and on the smooth grass by the side of a wood   beneath a broad oak that for ages had stood   saw the children of earth and the tenants of air   for an evening's amusement together repair   and there came the beetle so blind and so black   who carried the emmet his friend on his back   and there was the gnat and the dragon-fly too   with all their relations green orange and blue   and there came the moth with his plumage of down   and the hornet in jacket of yellow and brown   who with him the wasp his companion did bring   but they promised that evening to lay by their sting   and the sly little dormouse crept out of his hole   and brought to the feast his blind brother the mole   and the snail with his horns peeping out of his shell   came from a great distance the length of an ell   a mushroom their table and on it was laid   a water-dock leaf which a table-cloth made   the viands were various to each of their taste   and the bee brought her honey to crown the repast   then close on his haunches so solemn and wise   the frog from a corner look'd up to the skies   and the squirrel well pleased such diversions to see   mounted high over-head and look'd down from a tree   then out came the spider with finger so fine   to show his dexterity on the tight line   from one branch to another his cobwebs he slung   then quick as an arrow he darted along   but just in the middle oh shocking to tell   from his rope in an instant poor harlequin fell   yet he touch'd not the ground but with talons outspread   hung suspended in air at the end of a thread   then the grasshopper came with a jerk and a spring   very long was his leg though but short was his wing    he took but three leaps and was soon out of sight   then chirp'd his own praises the rest of the night   with step so majestic the snail did advance   and promised the gazers a minuet to dance   but they all laugh'd so loud that he pull'd in his head   and went in his own little chamber to bed   then as evening gave way to the shadows of night   their watchman the glowworm came out with a light      then home let us hasten while yet we can see   for no watchman is waiting for you and for me   so said little robert and pacing along   his merry companions return'd in a throng                                 the                         fancy fair                              or                           grand gala                            of the                     zoological gardens       some years are elapsed and some worthies are gone   since peacocks and butterflies mimick'd the ton   and gave in a manner becoming their station   their fêtes and their balls to their fellow-creation   then roscoe and dorset high-talented elves   amused other people and solaced themselves   in describing the revels the gibes and the jokes   of the creatures of earth and the feathery folks   of their fashion and fancy the ebbs and the flows   and the beauty and wit of their belles and their beaux   but the world has spun round like a peg top since then   and imparted more knowledge to brutes and to men   new lights and perceptions old customs explode   and what is done now must be done à-la-mode   old fashions are fled and what more can we say   than that dorset and roscoe might do for that day   but that poets must deck in more dignified rhymes   the wonderful deeds of these wonderful times   that augusta may spread her renown and her glory   her famed fancy fairs must be studded in story   and ages unborn learn the elegant games   of the gardens that bloom on the south of the thames   old dryden the bard was at best but a gander   in singing the feast of the great alexander   for what breast with the fumes of a banquet is fired   two thousand years after the guests have retired   our happier bard takes the season that suits   at the spur of the moment he puts on his boots   all hot for parnassus and cries in a hurry   prepare me my pegasus 'saddle white surrey'   it is clear that he feels what his numbers prolong   that he warms with his subject and soars in his song   but whether his lot be unhonour'd and low   or the wreath of the laureat encircles his brow   with the world to admire him mysterious elf   is a secret of state that he keeps to himself   but come zoological wonders require   the strains of his genius his force and his fire   he burns with impatience the scene to display    hark away to the gardens of taste hark away      the sun as he rose was received with a cheer   from the herald at arms the renown'd chanticleer   who proclaim'd with a feeling of pride in his breast   that the gardens of surrey were fairest and best   then at once the shrill tidings were borne on the air   that the dawn had arrived of the famed fancy fair   and that all that was lovely and beauteous and bright   was summon'd to honour that day of delight   the sunbeam was clear on that lovely retreat   the breath of the morning was balmy and sweet   fair flowrets that vied with the rainbow were seen   and trees in their livery of liveliest green   the voice of rejoicing from children of earth   was so mingled with cheerfulness music and mirth   that the mind and the eye and the ear and the heart   were saluted with pleasure from every part   a thousand gay faces appear'd in the throng   and crowds of fair creatures came trooping along   till the place all enliven'd with joy and surprise   was lit up with sunbeams and beauty's bright eyes   the groups of all ages were gather'd so well   that they threw o'er the poet and painter a spell   and the flashes of fancy wit feeling and fire   resistless compell'd them to pause and admire      much pains had been taken to add to the grace   and preserve from disorder the pride of the place   to keep the fair flowrets from wandering away   as well as the things that were fairer than they   for placards were posted near every spot   you may stand to admire me but gather me not      the beasts and the birds were so fresh and so fair   that they call'd forth the wonder of all who came there   and the boa constrictors so slimy and gay   that they seem'd to have painted themselves for the day   the green-bonnet monkey with speckles bespread   was proud of the verdigris tuft on his head   for it look'd as he leap'd in his frolic and joy   like the top of the turban of rammohun roy   dame tortoise roam'd over the green and beyond   for she pass'd on her pilgrimage right to the pond   as she gazed on the crocodile softly she sigh'd   though she thought that his mouth was a little too wide   the zebra look'd sprightly as every one saw   and the african sheep and white-footed nyl ghau   and that leaper of leapers the strange kangaroo   that is biped and triped and quadruped too   who out-juggles the juggler by hill and by dale   for he makes when he pleases a leg of his tail   with a soft silky aspect demure and profound   a tabby cat wander'd the gardens around   and purr'd her applause with a quiet delight   as she gazed half-entranced on the heart-cheering sight   among the rare wonders that caught every eye   demanding a glance from the gay passer-by   was the alpaca zebu of indian race   and the camel brought up in that beautiful place   a dome in the centre deservedly praised   transparent as crystal was artfully raised   where african lions and tigers untamed   and sloths and hyænas for savageness famed   and leopards and ladies and monsters and men   securely might meet in the very same pen      the crowd still increased on that magical ground   and thousands and thousands came trooping around   the haut ton and beau monde paced about debonair   tall and short enbonpoint slender sunburnt and fair   while hatred and anger and care fled away   and light hearts and bright eyes were the charm of the day   then the painted balloon in its glory was bright   and it mounted on high till it sail'd out of sight   the juggler with tricks and illusions came forth   and the russians with musical horns from the north   transporting enough to make orpheus mute    as loud as the trumpet as soft as the lute   they fill'd every bosom absorbing them quite   and the reeds seem'd to burden the air with delight   such strains have rung round me in seasons gone by   when escaped from the cloister i mused with a sigh   and listed awhile to the balm-shedding breeze   as it fitfully swept through the sedge and the trees   and plaintively whisper'd with musical power   o'er the soft-flowing avon at evening hour      and now the fair parties with mirth for their guide   and light-hearted laughter a moment divide   and gaze on the eagles the old ruin'd wall   the boat-house the temple the hermitage all   reproved when their pleasure too freely they quaff   by that memento mori the afric giraffe[1]        some visit the laughing-bird called cockatoo   who drops them a courtesy and cries how d' ye do   or mungo the negro who quaintly and sly   takes his tea cayenne pepper and cold apple-pie   some gaze on the cygnets that glide like a dream   and bend down to admire their fair forms in the stream   some laugh at their fancies or muse on a flower   and all are delighted so happy the hour   wouldst thou gaze with emotions far purer than mirth   on one of the fairest creations of earth   go at even and breathe the pure breath of the breeze   from the seat by the lake 'neath those wild willow-trees        new pleasures succeeded the spell was of power   that variety threw o'er the varying hour   and a change of enjoyment was found by the train   in losing and finding each other again   the dancing commenced and the fair beyond praise   as light as the gossamer tripp'd through the maze   what warm salutations what laughing aloud   what sounds of enjoyment were heard in the crowd   but who were the worthies who moved with a grace   and demeanour as though they belong'd to the place   prince eglantine eagle with lightning-like glare   threw a glance all around him to see who was there   to the pelican princesses bent his head low   as they proudly pass'd by with their bosoms of snow   duke emu too gazed on the heart-cheering sight   and earl hildebrand harpy so famous in fight   while the figure that walk'd so erect i suppose   was sir peregrine penguin i judge by his nose   viscount stork as he strutted about gave a beck   to earl vulture who wears no cravat round his neck   and the bishop was there though he stood rather back   array'd in his robes of red orange and black   sir archibald ostrich moved on rather chary   and lean'd on his cousin the count cassowary   discoursing of java and far distant lands   and african deserts and hot burning sands   old warrior flamingo came limping along   and with commodore cormorant join'd in the throng   profoundly debating with major macaw   the merits of martial and maritime law   earl heron walk'd stately with caroline crane   and field-marshal falcon of valour so vain   while captain crown pigeon so odd in his tread   shook the quaking-grass tuft on his fanciful head   lord peacock from asia came dress'd very fine    his musical taste ne'er accorded with mine   and the learn'd baron buzzard who gravely decided   that game when once caught should be fairly divided   the grenadier captain curassow was drest   in his helmet and held up his head with the best   while fatima pheasant from china display'd   her pekin pelisse of bright silver brocade   count turkey expanded the finery that bound him   and gabbled high dutch to the people around him   his honour the hawk loved a lark and a race   so he hover'd about near the courts of the place   colonel kite spoke of sporting of young ducks and widgeons   and plann'd a new pent-house for ring-doves and pigeons   at the edge of the water and hard by the sluice   tête-à-tête doctor drake sat with old gammer goose   and sir christopher crow wore a coat on his back   of a true day and martin-like polish of black   mother magpie and priscilla parrot in spite   could talk without ceasing from morning to night   spread abroad entre nous and on dits by the score   all the news they had heard and a hundred times more        a multitude muster'd escaped from the plains   of sight-loving lasses and holiday swains    bob bantam push'd forward and strutted before   will woodpecker modestly tapp'd at the door   poor robin the rustic a countrified clown   as he blush'd look'd too simple by half for the town   there were scores in brown mantles black yellow or green   from the villages round and among them were seen   luke linnet sam swallow mat martin and then   bill bullfinch tom titmouse and rosanna wren   but however select the fair party may be   where beauty and fashion preside we shall see   some characters doubtful that all should beware   and it can't be denied that a few such were there   those cut-throats the sparrows that robber the daw   who was pluck'd for his open contempt of the law   the pilferer cuckoo whom all must despise   and the chattering jay who tells nothing but lies   while the green-mantled light-hearted love-birds 'tis said   had been sipping too much for their noses were red      how often it is when the sun is most bright   that a dark cloud approaches obscuring his light   alas 'tis the same with all earthly affairs   and pleasure gives place to a dark crowd of cares   the trees were all lively the beasts were content   and the beautiful birds on their pleasure were bent   nothing doubting the multitude struck with amaze   came to gaze on their beauty and speak in their praise   when they saw that the crowd by degrees had retired   and that they left alone were no longer admired   they gazed on the booths that were aptly design'd   to display the fair merchandize art had combined   they look'd on the spot in wrath spleen and despair   rank beauty taste fashion and fancy were there   and the multitudes round such attractions preferr'd   to a gambolling beast or a chattering bird   now envy first enter'd the fair feather'd race   and invective and dissonance rung round the place   their pleasure their pride and contentment were o'er   and discord presided where peace was before      in the midst of the hubbub and riot around   the trees were absorb'd in a silence profound   till the busy dwarf medlar began to explain   his rooted dislike to the booth-loving train   he branch'd out in florid descriptions to show   that they all ought to stand on their stumps in a row   in defence of their rights now that underlings drew   that applause and renown which had long been their due   then the oak raised his head rather hoary with age   and shook his broad arms in the air in a rage   and exhorted them all with a feeling of pride   to maintain their ground firmly whate'er might betide   the giant elm follow'd and proudly look'd down   on the pitiful plots of their foes with a frown   the ash pale with anger derided the crew   and the smooth-temper'd purple beech look'd rather blue   the chesnut grew heated and roasted them well   and bitter the taunts of the almond-tree fell   the apple and pear both maintain'd in their spleen   that the fruit of their folly would shortly be seen   the laburnum the lime and the beech seem'd afraid   but the hawthorn was pointed in all that she said   and the threats of the elder were heard to abound    like pellets from popguns they rattled around   discontented and moody the drooping larch lower'd   the crab knit his brows for his temper was sour'd   while the birch-tree declared that the ill-fated elves   their opponents were making a rod for themselves   with wrath and vexation the maple ran o'er   the aspen-tree trembled the willow wept sore   the tulip-tree blush'd and the sumach-tree sigh'd   and the dyer's oak thought it a stain on their pride   the fir stood erect for he seem'd to opine   that their sun for a very brief season would shine   while the well-meaning walnut foreboding their fall   crack'd a joke for he cared not a fig for them all   the poplar drew up with a feeling of scorn   and the cypress looked sad and the yew was forlorn   the plane smoothly spoke and the hazel the same   but the scarlet oak redden'd with anger and shame   at last they resolved to blot out the disgrace   to stand fast by each other adorning the place   no longer their loss of applause to bemoan   but to come out next spring with a fair of their own      while the war-whoop was raised by the birds and the trees   the beasts were impatient to blow up a breeze   the lion began with a royal bewail   and furiously lash'd both his sides with his tail   as he stalk'd through his den his wild eyes glared around   and his roar seem'd to come from far under the ground   his anger disdain and despair wanted scope   so he wish'd himself back at the cape of good hope   the tiger extended in uttering a roar   a mouth that you might have mistook for the door   but in such a dilemma i warn you beware   how you enter in haste such a dark thoroughfare   for all who have pass'd through the passage they say   have terribly painted their coats by the way   poor bruin declared it was unbearable quite   and was in a brown study till day turn'd to night   the axis turn'd round in his rage and just then   the sloth look'd as black as the ink in my pen   the soft silky self-colour'd puma felt pain   pale as ashes with anger he could not restrain   the llama indignantly felt the disgrace   and spirted saliva in every one's face   in fury the mastiff bark'd loud for relief   the poor patient camel was laden with grief   the antelope wisely eloped from the fray   but the springbok was booked for the rest of the day   the wrath of the leopard then rose on the gale   and broke out in dark spots from his head to his tail   the civet cat mew'd and did nothing but fret   and the stripes of the zebra were blacker than jet   the opossum was posed and looked wondrously sage   and the red coati mondi turned sallow with rage   the hyæna declared in a quarrelsome mood   he would instantly break through his den if he could    and the moose deer in ire would have bit his lip through   but he found it already divided in two   the schoolmaster porcupine rang too the chimes    he declar'd that he'd send an address to the times   nay write all his quills to their stumps ere he'd stand   as a laughing-stock thus to the rest of the land      when the fair was concluded and all the gay throng   had abandon'd the feast and the dance and the song   in quest of a calmer enjoyment to roam   for home after every enjoyment is home   the trees toss'd their heads 'tween the earth and the heavens   and the birds and the beasts were at sixes and sevens      but amid the confusion the hubbub and din   all remember'd the proverb they laugh most who win   this was certainly true at the famed fancy fair   mr cross[2] was they say the most pleasant man there   let us hope then his genius was happily led   to allay the rude storm that hung over his head    that the future his spirited plans will repay   through many a gladsome and prosperous day   make true the old saw all is well that well ends   and bipeds and quadrupeds once more be friends     [1] the skeleton of the giraffe was exhibited in the gardens on       this occasion    [2] the late spirited proprietor of the surrey zoological gardens                               the end
